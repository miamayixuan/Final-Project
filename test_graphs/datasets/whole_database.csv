Maintenance of the targeting database. This would include the processing of updated information from beneficiaries as well as any incoming requests and applications. 
Under Component 2: Strengthening safety net operations (US$12.9 million), the TA project supported the introduction of cutting edge technology in payment, as well as updates and grievance redressal mechanisms. While to date the Pakistan Post remains the main payment agency, both mobile phone and smart card based payments have been successfully tested in several districts with support from the SSN TA project. The program has a manual grievance redressal system currently that is functional at Head Office and the Divisional and Regional offices of BISP (41 offices in total). The grievance redressal system has been addressing complaints concerning targeting, payments, quality of service, and information updates. To date, through resolution of targeting related grievances (primarily missing CNIC information) with the support of NADRA, CNIC information of more than 584,000 beneficiaries was updated and rendered eligible for payments. Further, active follow-up with other applicants concerning emission CNIC data resulted in additional 185,636 beneficiaries. Grievance Redressal concerning payments through smart cards or phone based mechanism has been fully operational. However, grievance redressal of payments through Pakistan Post has been a trying experience involving long delays and inconclusive results in many cases. This is one of the reasons BISP Management has taken the decision to shift its payment mechanism to technology based instruments.
Support provided under Component 1 also resulted in the establishment of a National Poverty Data Registry: PSC data from more than 20 million households has been processed already. The information collated from the PSC can be of immense value to social protection interventions in the country – both planned and those under implementation. BISP has already developed data sharing protocols which were recently approved by its Management Board.
