This README is for the following datasets used for tab 4:
50_4index.csv
hci.csv
index.csv
osi.csv
ranking.csv
tii.csv

The original dataset is published by the United Nations but due to maintenance of the UN website. I had to get the data from the
report published: https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/2018-un-e-government-survey.html. The difficulty is that the dataset
is a PDF file. I then used Tabula to extract data from the PDF. 

The original extracted data file is "ranking.csv".

50_4index filtered the top 50 ranked countries, using excel. 
hci, osi, and tii are individual index dataset, sorted from largest value to smallest value to filter the top 50 countries.
This is also done by using excel.
