		<h1>Digital Government</h1>
	 	<p> The USA </p>

	 	<h2> Some specific examples </h2>
	 	<br>
		<p> So lots of money has been spent on some important stuff. But what does that mean for normal people like you and me?</p>
		<p>Well, here are some of the digitalization projects that the US government has got going in the last few years. There’s lots of pesky acronyms, but we can handle those in a moment. The graph shows you how many people used a website in the last thirty days. Look at the top one: almost 200 million uses each month!</p>
		<p>So what does that website, do? The top one is the USA's postal service parcel tracking service: everyone wants to know where their packages are!</p>
		<p>What about the ncbi, which is visited almost 140 million times a month? It’s a really important website for doctors who are helping patients who are sick with cancer and other illnesses. When the doctor has a question, they can type their question into this website and get lots of specialised answers. Kind of like Google, but specially for doctors!</p>
		<p>Why do you think this digital tool might be useful for doctors? Well, imagine if every time they had a question they had to go to the library and look it up in a book. It would take ages! With this digital tool, they can get their answer much more quickly, which helps them give better care to their patients. Pretty important!</p>
