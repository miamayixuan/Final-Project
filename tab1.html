  <h1>Digital Government</h1>
	<h2>How much is being spent?</h2>
  <body>
  	<p> Digitizing government is big business. Since 1991, the World Bank alone has spent almost $80 billion on projects in this field. Worldwide, national aid agencies are committing to digitalization strategies and government digital services  are springing up to lead governments' domestic digitalisation efforts.
  <br>
  <br>

    But, since a peak in 2009, the World Bank has gradually scaled back its investment in digitalization projects, perhaps reflecting the adoption of digitalization projects by national governments so the Bank no longer needs to be the main player.
