  <h1>Digital Government</h1>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
  
  <body>


 <p> How many times have you had to write your name and birthday on a form to receive a government service? That's right. You don't know because you've lost count. Too. Many. Times.
<br>
<br>
Digital Government - sometimes known as e-government - is, essentially, about trying to get rid of these annoying, inefficient processes by using modern computerised technologies to get government to deliver services to its users - its citizens - better. 
<br>
<br>
How about applying for your driving license online using a simple few online steps, instead of a paper form that you have to mail in? Or requesting a new passport when your old one expires by clicking a simple button on your personal e-government homepage, instead of waiting in line at a ministry? Or, how about automatically starting to receive government parental payments after having a baby, because the hospital record - which has your address - sends an automated notification to the responsible ministry? No forms for you, just you receiving the services to which you are entitled as a citizen, without a pile of hassle. That's what digital government is about.  </p>
