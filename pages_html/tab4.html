  <body>
  	<p> The Open Government Partnership (OGP), set up in 2011, is a partnership between governments and civil society organisations that aims to improve accountable, responsive and inclusive governance. Since it was set up, seventy-eight countries have become members of the OGP. Two of the Partnership's flagship initiatives have been:
	<ul> 
  		<li>open data: increasing the amounts of open data and improving the quality of the data that is released.</li>
  		<br>
  		<li>digital governance: using digital technology to provide better services to citizens, as well as increasing transparency in government.</li>
  	</ul>
		You can find out more about which countries are part of the OGP and what they have done <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/our-members/#local">here</a>.
