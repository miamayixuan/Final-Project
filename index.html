    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>How many times have you had to write your name and birthday on a form to receive a government service? That's right. You probably don't know because you've lost count. Too. Many. Times.
    <br>
    <br>
    Digital Government - sometimes known as e-government - is, essentially, about trying to get rid of these annoying, inefficient processes by using modern computerised technologies to get government to deliver services to its users - its citizens - better. 
    <br>
    <br>
    How about applying for your driving license online using a simple few online steps, instead of a paper form that you have to mail in? Or requesting a new passport when your old one expires by clicking a simple button on your personal e-government homepage, instead of waiting in line at a ministry? Or, how about automatically starting to receive government parental payments after having a baby, because the hospital record - which has your address - sends an automated notification to the responsible ministry? No forms for you, just you receiving the services to which you are entitled as a citizen, without a pile of hassle. That's what digital government is about.
    <br>
    <br>
    This site will help you find out more about the digitalization of government services. You can find out how much money is being spent on it and what kinds of things this money is being spent on. You can also check out how well your country is doing, and compare it to other countries in the world! Then, you can use your detective skills to find out more elsewhere on the internet. Weâ€™ve given you some tips on how you could get started!
