    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <br>
    <p>How many times have you had to write your name and birthday on a form to receive a government service? That's right. You probably don't know because you've lost count. Too. Many. Times.</p>
    <p>Digital Government - sometimes known as e-government - is, essentially, about trying to get rid of these annoying, inefficient processes by using modern computerised technologies.</p>
    <p>How about applying for your driving license online using a simple few online steps, instead of a paper form that you have to mail in? Or, how about automatically starting to receive government parental payments after having a baby, because the hospital record - which has your address - sends an automated notification to the responsible ministry? No forms for you, just you receiving the services to which you are entitled as a citizen, without a pile of hassle. That's what digital government is about.</p>
    <p>This site will help you find out more about the digitalization of government services. To navigate, use the navigation bar at the top or click on the charts below.

        <p>This website was created as the final project for the 'Data and Programming for Policy Makers' course at Harvard's Kennedy School, <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/courses/programming-and-data-policymakers"> DPI-691M.</a> <br>
        <br>
        Prior to this two week course, the team members had little, if any, experience in any of the programming techniques and languages used. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, the Command Line and Github</p>
