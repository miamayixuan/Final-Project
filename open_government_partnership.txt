The Open Government Partnership (OGP), set up in 2011, is a partnership between governments and civil society organisations that aims to improve accountable, responsive and inclusive governance. Since it was set up, seventy-eight countries have become members of the OGP. Two of the Partnership's flagship initiatives have been:
	- open data: increasing the amounts of open data and improving the quality of the data that is released.

	- digital governance: using digital technology to provide better services to citizens, as well as increasing transparency in government.
